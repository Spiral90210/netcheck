## Getting Started

This is nodejs based running off stable (there is a `.nvmrc` file to use as well).

```bash
# Install dependencies with npm
npm install
```

By default the server will bind to a random port. If you want to specify a specifc one (recommended if you want to have a browser shortcut to run), then you can `cp .env.example .env` and change the value there.
